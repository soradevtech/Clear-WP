# Clear Development Theme

A starting point for WordPress development projects.

## Sass Preprocessor
I like to use [Koala](http://koala-app.com/ "Koala website") https://github.com/oklai/koala to compile my Sass. This app is no longer supported, so on newer linux distributions you may need libgconf-2.so.4 which can be gotten by installing libgconf2-4 or GConf2. I've run into the same issue with [Scout](https://scout-app.io/) as well.

#### To display the menu
In WordPress admin under Appearance:Menus, create a menu called 'Main Menu'. Add whichever menu options you would like and save. Make sure to set the display location for Main Menu. You may have to use a static homepage and/or blog index page under Settings:Reading.

#### Just looking for good ol' HTML?
You can find just the HTML counterpart at https://github.com/rjmccollam/Bare-HTML.
