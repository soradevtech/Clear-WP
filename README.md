# Bare Development Theme

A starting point for WordPress development projects.

## Sass Preprocessor
I like to use [Koala](http://koala-app.com/ "Koala website") https://github.com/oklai/koala to compile my Sass. This app is no longer supported, so on newer linux distributions you may need libgconf-2.so.4 which can be gotten by installing libgconf2-4 or GConf2. I've run into the same issue with [Scout](https://scout-app.io/) as well.
